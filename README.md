# ERC-721 Smart Contract

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating and deploying an ERC-721 smart contract and minting the token on Optimism Kovan-Testnet using Solidity, Hardhat and Pinata. 

By the end of this tutorial - you'll be able to mint an NFT and display it on [Quixotic](https://testnet.quixotic.io/) (an NFT marketplace on Optimism) from your deployed ERC721 contract.
